# Project Specification
Nausicaä’s Global Green Initiative The end customer would like an online application system for range of grants to support climate change initiatives. This is part of Studio Ghibli’s sustainable planet goals. Their most popular grant is Teto which provides funds of up to €10,000. The system must take details of customer and their funding requirements map them to the grant of their choice along with a single box for extra set of special award applications. The system should be clean and simple. Your team has been tasked with creating the pipeline for the SDLC. You have also been asked to provide a simple prototype page(s) to test the pipeline. The system needs to take into account the usual security requirements. The administrator of the end system (Nausicaä Enterprises) should be able to access detailed information and edit as appropriate. Once the client enters details it should not be able to be changed by the grant applicant.

Clean and simple design
User access levels (client, administrator)
Includes at least one self developed api and one webservice
to be run.

# Frameworks
Database
Database persistence technology

Define the buisness Requirements
1.Online Grant Application System - Develop an online platform for grant applications supporting climate change initiatives
2.Grant Types - Provide different grant options, including the popular Teto grant offering funds up to €10,000
3.User Registration and Details Collection - Gather applicant details and funding requirements to map them to suitable grants. Include an additional field for special award applications.
4.Administrator Access - Allow Nausicaä Enterprises to access and edit detailed information securely.
5.Data Security - Ensure robust security measures to protect applicant data and prevent unauthorized changes once submitted.
6.Clean and Simple Interface - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for ease of use by grant applicants.
7.Prototype Development - Create simple prototype pages to test the system's functionalities and validate the pipeline developed for the project.

Named queries and database triggers for security
Regex for cleansing and validation of data before sending to the database.
